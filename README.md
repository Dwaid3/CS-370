Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The work I did on this project was to apply the machine learning techniques taught throughout this class. For this project I applied deep Q-learning algorithms to train my pirate agent. I was given starter code that includes all of the game and pirates functioncality and was asked to use the given code and a the Q learning algorithm to train the agents. The object of this said agent is to navigate the pregenerated map to find the hidden treasure.


Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientist are professional problem solvers. They can use many methods to solve these problems. They study the science of computers and use the knowledge they have to solve various problems. This matters because this is a technology era and computer scientist are leading the way in advancing our lives in many way.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

The way I approach is to first try understand what it is I am trying to accomplish. The next thing I will do is brainstorm and develop a proposed solution. After that I will attempt to implement my solution and lastly I will evaluate the solution and see if it was effective. If not the cycle starts all over again

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As a professional, ethical responsibilities to both end users and the organization are paramount. Transparency and honesty in communication, coupled with a commitment to privacy and data security, form the foundation of ethical conduct. Fair treatment, non-discrimination, and a dedication to delivering high-quality work underscore the importance of equitable practices. Continuous learning, accountability for actions, and compliance with laws and regulations are essential components.
